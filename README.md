# NumberClassifier
using scikit learn to identify numbers!
This notebook explores the use of a Perceptron, a type of linear classifier, to classify handwritten digits from the scikit-learn digits dataset. The dataset contains 8x8 grayscale images representing digits (0-9), which are used to train and evaluate the model for both binary and multi-class classification tasks. Initially, the problem is framed as a binary classification to predict whether a digit is "0" or not, followed by extending the model to classify all digits. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the Perceptron is trained using the training data. The model achieves high accuracy on both training and test sets, demonstrating effective learning. The learned weights are visualized as images to interpret how the model distinguishes digit shapes. Additionally, error analysis reveals the number of misclassifications for each digit, highlighting areas for improvement. This project showcases the practical application of linear classifiers in image recognition and provides insights into their performance and interpretability.
